# MAC2166

This is an eletrical engineering class that I attend to, the programs here are indexed only for portfolio and nostalgia reasons, I condeem any use of my code for plagiarism!
This Repos was kept PRIVATE until the end of the semester.

## Compiler

In order to compile the C code, use these settings:

    gcc .\main.c -o main.exe -Wall -ansi -pedantic -O2

## Thanks

Special thanks to Yoshiharu Kohayakawa, my professor at Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo!
